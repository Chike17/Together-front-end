If a work-in-progress render is discarded before finishing,\n// we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n//\n// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an\n// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a\n// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than\n// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's\n// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the\n// work-in-progress.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F\n//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F\n//                                          ^\n//                                          The work-in-progress queue has\n//                                          processed more updates than current.\n//\n// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop\n// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to\n// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in\n// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add\n// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already\n// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by\n// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next\n// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the\n// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same\n// update twice.)\n//\n// Prioritization\n// --------------\n//\n// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always\n// appended to the end of the list.\n//\n// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue\n// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are\n// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient\n// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower\n// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority\n// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities. We also\n// keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first\n// update in the queue is applied.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Given a base state of '', and the following queue of updates\n//\n//     A1 - B2 - C1 - D2\n//\n//   where the number indicates the priority, and the update is applied to the\n//   previous state by appending a letter, React will process these updates as\n//   two separate renders, one per distinct priority level:\n//\n//   First render, at priority 1:\n//     Base state: ''\n//     Updates: [A1, C1]\n//     Result state: 'AC'\n//\n//   Second render, at priority 2:\n//     Base state: 'A'            <-  The base state does not include C1,\n//                                    because B2 was skipped.\n//     Updates: [B2, C1, D2]      <-  C1 was rebased on top of B2\n//     Result state: 'ABCD'\n//\n// Because we process updates in insertion order, and rebase high priority\n// updates when preceding updates are skipped, the final result is deterministic\n// regardless of priority. Intermediate state may vary according to system\n// resources, but the final state is always the same.\n\nvar UpdateState = 0;\nvar ReplaceState = 1;\nvar ForceUpdate = 2;\nvar CaptureUpdate = 3;\n\n// Global state that is reset at the beginning of calling `processUpdateQueue`.\n// It should only be read right after calling `processUpdateQueue`, via\n// `checkHasForceUpdateAfterProcessing`.\nvar hasForceUpdate = false;\n\nvar didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = void 0;\nvar currentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\nvar resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\n{\n  didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = false;\n  currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = function () {\n    currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  };\n}\n\nfunction createUpdateQueue(baseState) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: baseState,\n    firstUpdate: null,\n    lastUpdate: null,\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction cloneUpdateQueue(currentQueue) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: currentQueue.baseState,\n    firstUpdate: currentQueue.firstUpdate,\n    lastUpdate: currentQueue.lastUpdate,\n\n    // TODO: With resuming, if we bail out and resuse the child tree, we should\n    // keep these effects.\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction createUpdate(expirationTime) {\n  return {\n    expirationTime: expirationTime,\n\n    tag: UpdateState,\n    payload: null,\n    callback: null,\n\n    next: null,\n    nextEffect: null\n  };\n}\n\nfunction appendUpdateToQueue(queue, update) {\n  // Append the update to the end of the list.\n  if (queue.lastUpdate === null) {\n    // Queue is empty\n    queue.firstUpdate = queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  } else {\n    queue.lastUpdate.next = update;\n    queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction enqueueUpdate(fiber, update) {\n  // Update queues are created lazily.\n  var alternate = fiber.alternate;\n  var queue1 = void 0;\n  var queue2 = void 0;\n  if (alternate === null) {\n    // There's only one fiber.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = null;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      queue1 = fiber.updateQueue = createUpdateQueue(fiber.memoizedState);\n    }\n  } else {\n    // There are two owners.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = alternate.updateQueue;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      if (queue2 === null) {\n        // Neither fiber has an update queue.

This makes it easy to combine extractors.\r\n * combineExtractors() does the work of combining them, keeping track of the cursor through multiple extractions.\r\n * Some extractions are super dumb and simpleParse and fromStrings help DRY them.\r\n */\n\nfunction combineRegexes() {\n  for (var _len = arguments.length, regexes = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n    regexes[_key] = arguments[_key];\n  }\n\n  var full = regexes.reduce(function (f, r) {\n    return f + r.source;\n  }, \"\");\n  return RegExp(\"^\" + full + \"$\");\n}\n\nfunction combineExtractors() {\n  for (var _len2 = arguments.length, extractors = new Array(_len2), _key2 = 0; _key2 < _len2; _key2++) {\n    extractors[_key2] = arguments[_key2];\n  }\n\n  return function (m) {\n    return extractors.reduce(function (_ref, ex) {\n      var mergedVals = _ref[0],\n          mergedZone = _ref[1],\n          cursor = _ref[2];\n\n      var _ex = ex(m, cursor),\n          val = _ex[0],\n          zone = _ex[1],\n          next = _ex[2];\n\n      return [Object.assign(mergedVals, val), mergedZone || zone, next];\n    }, [{}, null, 1]).slice(0, 2);\n  };\n}\n\nfunction parse(s) {\n  if (s == null) {\n    return [null, null];\n  }\n\n  for (var _len3 = arguments.length, patterns = new Array(_len3 > 1 ? _len3 - 1 : 0), _key3 = 1; _key3 < _len3; _key3++) {\n    patterns[_key3 - 1] = arguments[_key3];\n  }\n\n  for (var _i = 0, _patterns = patterns; _i < _patterns.length; _i++) {\n    var _patterns$_i = _patterns[_i],\n        regex = _patterns$_i[0],\n        extractor = _patterns$_i[1];\n    var m = regex.exec(s);\n\n    if (m) {\n      return extractor(m);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return [null, null];\n}\n\nfunction simpleParse() {\n  for (var _len4 = arguments.length, keys = new Array(_len4), _key4 = 0; _key4 < _len4; _key4++) {\n    keys[_key4] = arguments[_key4];\n  }\n\n  return function (match, cursor) {\n    var ret = {};\n    var i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n      ret[keys[i]] = parseInteger(match[cursor + i]);\n    }\n\n    return [ret, null, cursor + i];\n  };\n} // ISO and SQL parsing\n\n\nvar offsetRegex = /(?:(Z)|([+-]\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d))?)/,\n    isoTimeBaseRegex = /(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?:[.,](\\d{1,9}))?)?)?/,\n    isoTimeRegex = RegExp(\"\" + isoTimeBaseRegex.source + offsetRegex.source + \"?\"),\n    isoTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp(\"(?:T\" + isoTimeRegex.source + \")?\"),\n    isoYmdRegex = /([+-]\\d{6}|\\d{4})(?:-?(\\d\\d)(?:-?(\\d\\d))?)?/,\n    isoWeekRegex = /(\\d{4})-?W(\\d\\d)(?:-?(\\d))?/,\n    isoOrdinalRegex = /(\\d{4})-?(\\d{3})/,\n    extractISOWeekData = simpleParse(\"weekYear\", \"weekNumber\", \"weekDay\"),\n    extractISOOrdinalData = simpleParse(\"year\", \"ordinal\"),\n    sqlYmdRegex = /(\\d{4})-(\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d)/,\n    // dumbed-down version of the ISO one\nsqlTimeRegex = RegExp(isoTimeBaseRegex.source + \" ?(?:\" + offsetRegex.source + \"|(\" + ianaRegex.source + \"))?\"),\n    sqlTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp(\"(?: \" + sqlTimeRegex.source + \")?\");\n\nfunction extractISOYmd(match, cursor) {\n  var item = {\n    year: parseInteger(match[cursor]),\n    month: parseInteger(match[cursor + 1]) || 1,\n    day: parseInteger(match[cursor + 2]) || 1\n  };\n  return [item, null, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOTime(match, cursor) {\n  var item = {\n    hour: parseInteger(match[cursor]) || 0,\n    minute: parseInteger(match[cursor + 1]) || 0,\n    second: parseInteger(match[cursor + 2]) || 0,\n    millisecond: parseMillis(match[cursor + 3])\n  };\n  return [item, null, cursor + 4];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOOffset(match, cursor) {\n  var local = !match[cursor] && !match[cursor + 1],\n      fullOffset = signedOffset(match[cursor + 1], match[cursor + 2]),\n      zone = local ? null : FixedOffsetZone.instance(fullOffset);\n  return [{}, zone, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractIANAZone(match, cursor) {\n  var zone = match[cursor] ?

It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\n *\n * A DateTime comprises of:\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\n *\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toRelative}, {@link toRelativeCalendar}, {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, {@link toMillis} and {@link toJSDate}.\n *\n * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.\n */\n\n\nvar DateTime =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction () {\n  /**\n   * @access private\n   */\n  function DateTime(config) {\n    var zone = config.zone || Settings.defaultZone,\n        invalid = config.invalid || (Number.isNaN(config.ts) ? new Invalid(\"invalid input\") : null) || (!zone.isValid ? unsupportedZone(zone) : null);\n    /**\n     * @access private\n     */\n\n    this.ts = isUndefined(config.ts) ?

\"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)\n *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually\n *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units\n *    are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).\n *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`\n *\n * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,\n *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:\n *\n *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |\n *    |------|------|------|\n *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |\n *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |\n *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |\n *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}\n *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).\n *\n * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,\n *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.\n *\n * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `t`: seconds timestamp\n *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 8. These tokens are often confused with others. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - The second argument is now required for the sake of explicitness.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1))\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1), \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx\")\n *   ```\n *\n * - New format string API for `format` function\n *   which is based on [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).\n *   See [this post](https://blog.date-fns.org/post/unicode-tokens-in-date-fns-v2-sreatyki91jg) for more details.\n *\n * - Characters are now escaped using single quote symbols (`'`) instead of square brackets.\n *\n * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date\n * @param {String} format - the string of tokens\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)\n * @param {Number} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number\n *      as wide as the sequence\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `baseDate`:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`\n *\n *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\n *\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *\n * 6. These tokens are often confused with others. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n *\n * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),\n * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `baseDate` which works as a context of parsing.\n *\n * `baseDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.\n * If you're not sure which `baseDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:\n * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`\n * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.\n * If `baseDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,\n * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n *\n * The result may vary by locale.\n *\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `baseDate` will be returned.\n *\n * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.\n * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - Old `parse` was renamed to `toDate`.\n *   Now `parse` is a new function which parses a string using a provided format.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   parse('2016-01-01')\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   toDate('2016-01-01')\n *   parse('2016-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd', new Date())\n *   ```\n *\n * @param {String} dateString - the string to parse\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\n * @param {Date|Number} baseDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}\n * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)\n * @param {1|2|3|4|5|6|7} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is always in the first week of the year\n * @param {Boolean} [options.awareOfUnicodeTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of Unicode tokens causes confusion:\n *   - Some of the day of year tokens (`D`, `DD`) that are confused with the day of month tokens (`d`, `dd`).\n *   - Some of the local week-numbering year tokens (`YY`, `YYYY`) that are confused with the calendar year tokens (`yy`, `yyyy`).\n *   See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @returns {Date} the parsed date\n * @throws {TypeError} 3 arguments required\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.weekStartsOn` must be between 0 and 6\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.firstWeekContainsDate` must be between 1 and 7\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `match` property\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.awareOfUnicodeTokens` must be set to `true` to use `XX` token; see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * @example\n * // Parse 11 February 2014 from middle-endian format:\n * var result = parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())\n * //=> Tue Feb 11 2014 00:00:00\n *\n * @example\n * // Parse 28th of February in Esperanto locale in the context

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

It's built upon the\n * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)\n * component, so it inherits all of its props.\n *\n * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,\n * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSSS transition. After the\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\n * transition state.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\"my-node\">\n *         <div>\n *           {\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\"}\n *         </div>\n *       </CSSTransition>\n *       <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\n * _appearance_.\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-node-enter {\n *   opacity: 0;\n * }\n * .my-node-enter-active {\n *   opacity: 1;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit {\n *   opacity: 1;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit-active {\n *   opacity: 0;\n *   transition: opacity: 200ms;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**.\n */\n\n\nvar CSSTransition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\n\n  function CSSTransition() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n\n    _this.onEnter = function (node, appearing) {\n      var _this$getClassNames = _this.getClassNames(appearing ?
